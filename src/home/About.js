            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p> Within the past year, 43.5 million unpaid caregivers have provided necessary care for an adult or child within the U.S. This often requires complicated logistics and coordination to provide even the basic level of care for those in need. Communication amongst the care team in regards to the activities of daily living can be challenging, thus providing an opportunity to solve this problem through a caregiving app.</p>
            <h3>Who?</h3>
           <p>The target audience for the CompanionPath app are families and those caring for clients and loved ones with special needs.</p> 
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>CompanionPath provides an easy to use platform for logging patients and activities of daily living for the individual receiving care. Upon user login, the user can do the following:
                <li>Add Patient</li>
                <li>Update Patient</li>
                <li>Delete Patient</li>
                <li>Find patient</li>
            </p>
        </div>
